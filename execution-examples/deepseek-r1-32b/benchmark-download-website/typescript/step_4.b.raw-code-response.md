Okay, I need to create a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the complete HTML content of the website as a string. Let's see what libraries I can use based on the given information.

First, the system suggests using axios for making HTTP requests. But wait, looking at the internal libraries provided, there's a function called downloadPages which converts HTML to Markdown. However, that's not needed here because I just need the raw HTML content.

The problem requires me to fetch the HTML from a URL. So, using axios would be a good choice since it's an HTTP client library. But wait, in the Deno runtime, maybe there's a better way without adding external dependencies. Oh, but the code can use npm libraries with the 'npm:' prefix if needed.

Wait, the user provided that the code will run with Deno Runtime, so I should prefer Deno's default libraries first. However, for making HTTP requests, using fetch is available in the global scope. So maybe I don't need axios at all. That would simplify things and avoid adding external dependencies.

So, the plan is: use fetch to get the HTML content from the given URL. Then, return that content as a string.

Let me structure the code:

1. Define the types for config, inputs, and output.
   - CONFIG is empty since there are no configuration parameters.
   - INPUTS will have a url property of type string.
   - OUTPUT will have a content property of type string.

2. Implement the run function which takes config and inputs as parameters.

3. Inside the run function:
   a. Extract the URL from inputs.url.
   b. Use fetch to get the HTML content from that URL.
   c. Read the response text using response.text().
   d. Return the content in the specified output format.

I should also handle any potential errors, like if the URL is invalid or the request fails. But since the problem statement doesn't specify error handling, I'll proceed without it for now.

Wait, but what about encoding? Fetch's text() method returns the body as a string decoded with UTF-8 by default. That should be fine for most cases unless the website uses a different encoding.

So, putting it all together, the code will use fetch to get the HTML content and return it.

To solve this problem, we need to create a tool that takes a URL as input and returns the complete HTML content of the website as a string. The solution should be efficient and leverage available libraries appropriately while adhering to best practices for web scraping.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is straightforward: fetch the HTML content from a given URL. We need to handle potential errors gracefully but focus on the core functionality first.
2. **Library Selection**: Given that we're using Deno, which supports modern JavaScript features, we can use the built-in `fetch` API for making HTTP requests. This avoids the need for external dependencies like `axios`.
3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Use `fetch` to make a GET request to the provided URL.
   - Convert the response to text using `response.text()`.
   - Return this text as the content in the specified output format.

### Solution Code
```typescript
export async function run(config: {}, inputs: { url: string }): Promise<{ content: string }> {
    const url = inputs.url;
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        const htmlContent = await response.text();
        return { content: htmlContent };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching the URL:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Input Handling**: The function `run` accepts a configuration object and an input object containing the URL.
- **HTTP Request**: Using `fetch`, we send a GET request to the specified URL. This is efficient and leverages Deno's capabilities without external libraries.
- **Response Handling**: The response is checked for HTTP errors. If successful, the content is read as text using `response.text()`.
- **Error Management**: Any errors during fetching (e.g., network issues, invalid URLs) are caught, logged, and rethrown to handle them appropriately in the calling context.

This approach ensures that we efficiently fetch and return the HTML content of a webpage while adhering to best practices for error handling and resource management.
