Okay, so I need to figure out how to adjust the tool to use Axios for downloading a website's HTML content. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The original plan used Deno's fetch API to get the webpage content. Now, the user wants to switch to using Axios, which is an external library. I remember that Axios is a popular HTTP client that works well with both browsers and Node.js, so it should be suitable for this task.

First, I'll need to include Axios as an external library in the system libraries section. Since it's not part of Deno's runtime or internal tools, it falls under external libraries. The user specifically mentioned "npm:axios", which tells me that it's a Node.js package available via npm. So, I'll add axios there.

Next, looking at the requirements, the tool should still take a URL and return the HTML content as a string. Using Axios, I can make a GET request to the provided URL. The response will give me the HTML data, which I can then pass back in the output format specified.

I also need to ensure that the example input and output remain consistent with what was provided before. The tool's functionality doesn't change; only the method of fetching the webpage content does.

Wait a minuteâ€”do I still need to mention the fetch API as a system library if I'm switching to Axios? Since Axios is now handling the HTTP requests, perhaps I can remove fetch from the system libraries. But looking back, the instructions say to prioritize using system libraries first before internal and external ones. However, since the user explicitly requested using Axios, it makes sense to include it as an external library.

I should also consider any potential changes in how errors are handled with Axios compared to fetch. For example, Axios might throw different types of errors or handle HTTP status codes slightly differently. But for this task, assuming that a basic GET request works without issues is acceptable unless specified otherwise.

In summary, the main change is replacing the use of Deno's fetch API with Axios for making HTTP requests. This involves adding axios as an external library and adjusting the implementation to use Axios methods instead of fetch.

# Requirements
A tool that takes a URL as input and returns the complete HTML content of the website as a string.

# System Libraries
axios  : For making HTTP requests to download web pages

# Internal Libraries
downloadPages  : Converts HTML content to Markdown (not needed for this task)
readFileContents  : Reads file contents from a path (not needed for this task)

# External Libraries
axios  : HTTP client library for making GET requests to websites

# Example Inputs and Outputs  
Input: { "url": "https://example.com" }
Output: { "content": "<html>...</html>" }
