Okay, so I need to figure out how to generate a list of tool-router-keys based on the provided document. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, looking at the rules, I see that I have to extract internal libraries from the input command and convert them into their corresponding tool-router-keys. The output should be a JSON array of these keys.

In the input_command section, under "# Internal Libraries", there are two entries: downloadPages and readFileContents. But wait, the note says they're not needed for this task. However, the rules specify that I must include only the internal libraries mentioned in that section, regardless of whether they're needed or not. So I should still consider them.

Now, looking at the tool_router_key section, each key is structured like "local:::__official_shinkai:::something". My task is to map each internal library name to its corresponding tool-router-key.

Let me check each internal library:

1. downloadPages: From the tool_router_key list, I see a key named "download_pages" (case-insensitive match). The corresponding tool-router-key is "local:::__official_shinkai:::download_pages".

2. readFileContents: Similarly, in the tool_router_key list, there's "read_file_contents". So its key is "local:::__official_shinkai:::read_file_contents".

Wait, but the user specified that these are not needed for this task. But according to the rules, I should include all internal libraries listed, regardless of their usage. So both should be included.

Now, formatting the output as a JSON array:

["local:::__official_shinkai:::download_pages", "local:::__official_shinkai:::read_file_contents"]

I think that's it. I don't include any external or system libraries because the rules specify to focus only on internal ones.

```json
     ["local:::__official_shinkai:::download_pages", "local:::__official_shinkai:::read_file_contents"]
```
