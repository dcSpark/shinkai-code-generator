Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a document that describes a software tool and wants me to extract the external libraries used in it. 

First, I'll read through the document carefully. It mentions Requirements, System Libraries, Internal Libraries, External Libraries, Example Inputs and outputs. My focus is on the "External Libraries" section because that's where the relevant information is located.

Looking at the "External Libraries" part, there's only one library listed: axios. The description says it's an HTTP client library used for making GET requests to websites. 

My task is to extract these external libraries and present them as a JSON array. Since there's only one library here, the array will contain just that name.

I need to ensure that I don't include any other sections like System Libraries or Internal Libraries. The output must be concise and exact, so no additional words are needed beyond the library names in the JSON array.

Finally, I'll format this into a JSON array as specified, making sure it's correctly structured with proper syntax.

```json
     ["axios"]
```
