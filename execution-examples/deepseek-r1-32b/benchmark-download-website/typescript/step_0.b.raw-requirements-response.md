Alright, so I need to figure out how to generate a tool that downloads a website and returns the complete HTML as a string. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the requirements provided. The user wants a tool that takes a URL as input and outputs the HTML content of that webpage. That makes senseâ€”downloading a website's HTML is a common task for web scraping or data extraction purposes.

Next, I consider the system libraries available in Deno. Since we're using Deno, built-in modules are crucial. The fetch API comes to mind because it allows making HTTP requests. Using fetch, I can send a GET request to the provided URL and retrieve the response. Then, I'll need to read the body of this response as text to get the HTML content.

Looking at internal libraries, I notice there's `downloadPages` which converts HTML to Markdown. However, that doesn't directly help here because we just want the raw HTML. So, maybe we can use fetch without relying on this tool if it's not necessary.

For external libraries, there are options like Cheerio or Puppeteer. Cheerio is great for parsing HTML and extracting data using CSS selectors, but since our task is simply to download the page, it might be overkill. Puppeteer could also be used, especially if we need to render JavaScript-heavy pages, but again, that's beyond the current requirement.

In terms of internal libraries, `readFileContents` can read files from a path, but that doesn't apply here because we're dealing with URLs. So, sticking with Deno's fetch API seems most efficient and straightforward.

I should also consider error handling. What if the URL is invalid or the site doesn't respond? The tool should handle such cases gracefully, perhaps by throwing an error or returning a specific message.

Putting it all together, the tool will use the `fetch` function to get the webpage, read the response as text, and return that content in a JSON object. This approach keeps things simple and efficient without unnecessary dependencies.

# Requirements
A tool that takes a URL as input and returns the complete HTML content of the website as a string.

# System Libraries
fetch : Fetch API for making HTTP requests to download web pages
response : Built-in type for handling HTTP responses

# Internal Libraries
downloadPages : Converts HTML content to Markdown (not needed for this task)
readFileContents : Reads file contents from a path (not needed for this task)

# External Libraries
 Cheerio : For parsing and manipulating HTML if needed (not required for basic download)
 Puppeteer : For advanced web scraping with JavaScript rendering (not needed for basic download)

# Example Inputs and Outputs  
Input: { "url": "https://example.com" }
Output: { "content": "<html>...</html>" }
