To generate a tool that can send an SMS message to a given phone number, none of the provided functions directly support sending SMS messages. However, if we were to hypothetically select a function from this list for some kind of related task (e.g., creating a message), the closest match would be:

- `shinkaiEcho(message: string)`

This function echoes the input message, which could be part of a larger system where you handle sending SMS messages elsewhere. But strictly speaking, none of these functions can send an SMS message as requested.
